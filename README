	Ok, here's the deal on these widgets:

	They are partially functional. This means that things like
the SetValues procedure is not written.  But it doesn't mean
that these things aren't functional -- in fact they have to be
since I use them in the program I write for my company.  So you
can assume that any bugs I find will be fixed, and any features
will be added if I need them. (Some day I'll have time and
revamp all my widgets.)

	If this bothers you, then don't use these. They are free ya know...
(I'm way too busy to get these to the distribution quality I would like,
but I probably will someday -- not bad for 5 days of work though...)
These widgets work with Motif 1.2.4 (that's what I use...)

	So we have:

XmGUIFileBoxWidget: Replacement for the XmFileSelectionBoxWidget.
	Features:
		standard and advanced modes
		multiple file filter specification
		simple and/or regular file pattern matching. For example
			you can have "*.[cC] *.out \R.*\.bob$" as the filter string.
			The first two should be obvious. The last, if a filter piece
			starts with \R then it is a regular expression match.
		single/double column layout with icons
		file completion (almost done for the selection too...), jump to selection
		Two actions:  GUIFileBoxCompleteSelection(), GUIFileBoxScrollToFirstFile()
		Pre/Pos update callbacks so you can pop up your favorite wait cursor.
		Someday I hope to get the iconpair resource to read a MIME type of file
		and display the correct icon. (For now I plan to be clever and make our
		programs icon show up in the browser for our types of files...)


XmIconListWidget: List widget with icons.  Currently uses XDrawString and char*'s
	I'll update to XmStrings someday...

XmDumbClipWidget: Clip widget that asks it child how big it should be. The XmDrawingArea
	wasn't doing what I wanted and was driving me insane...

guifbff.*: general file searching/matching routines (not-cached like the Motif ones,
		but oh well)

xreg*.[ch]: regular expression matching stuff. NOTE I couldn't find anything that
	REALLY defined what kind of regexp stuff a machine has, so you will probably
	have to #define one of REGEXP, REGCOMP or REG_EXEC to get it to work correctly
	If filtering doesn't seem to work, try another regexp #define.

If you #define SMARTMB you get the convenience of using pre-created dialog boxes
for the XmGUIFileBoxWidget. Needs my SmartMB widget at ftp.x.org:/contrib/widgets

If you #define SUBPLUSS you get the convenience of using menus with the correct
visual set.


	The demo program doesn't really do the widget justice without the SmartMB widget
stuff.  It will come up in Standard mode. Set the resource *dialogMode: advanced_mode
to see the advanced mode.

	I do dual development on SPARC and Linux so this has been tested on those two platforms.

	Feel free to send any bug reports to cwikla@wolfram.com.
